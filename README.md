# Suggestify

**Suggestify** is a web application allows people to recommend tracks they think I should listen to. It features a search functionality to find tracks, a preview option to listen to them, and a public list of suggested tracks. The app is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and utilizes the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/) for music data.

## Features

- **Search Tracks**: Find your favorite songs or discover new ones.
- **Preview Music**: Listen to song previews directly within the app.
- **Public Playlist**: View and suggest tracks to be added to the public playlist.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) for server-side rendering and React-based UI.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling.
- **Backend**: Server-side logic powered by Astro API routes.
- **Third-party Integration**:
  - [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/) for fetching song data.
  - [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) for bot protection.
  - [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) to send notifications directly to your phone.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
